                <small>Early Concerns and Foundations</small>
                <p>The rapid urbanization of the post-World War II era led to significant 
                    concerns about the growth of slums, inadequate infrastructure, and 
                    environmental degradation in cities. The concept of sustainable 
                    development began to take shape, with early reports and conferences 
                    addressing urban challenges, including the 1976 Vancouver Conference 
                    on Human Settlements.</p>

                <p>The Brundtland Commission's 1987 report, "Our Common Future," 
                    introduced the concept of sustainable development and highlighted 
                    the need for balanced growth that does not compromise the ability 
                    of future generations to meet their needs. The idea of sustainable 
                    urban development began to gain traction.</p>

                    culminating in the Habitat II conference in 1996, which resulted 
                    in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda. 
                    These documents outlined strategies for improving the living conditions 
                    in urban areas and laid the groundwork for future sustainable urban development

                    all United Nations Member States during the UN Sustainable

                    included as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 
                    This goal was designed to address the specific challenges of 
                    urbanization, such as ensuring safe and affordable housing, 
                    sustainable transport, and resilience to disasters.</p>

                <p>By 2025, significant advancements in smart city technologies are expected, 
                    including enhanced data analytics and improved integration of the Internet 
                    of Things (IoT) to better urban living conditions. By 2030, the target year
                     for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), substantial 
                     progress is anticipated in reducing urban inequality, improving public 
                     transportation, and increasing green spaces. Beyond 2030, efforts will 
                     continue to maintain and build upon the progress made, with a particular 
                     focus on adapting to emerging challenges such as climate change and 
                     population growth.</p>
