        <h2>Early Concerns and Foundations</h2>
        <p>1960s-1970s: The rapid urbanization of the post-World War II era led to significant concerns about the growth of slums, inadequate infrastructure, and environmental degradation in cities. The concept of sustainable development began to take shape, with early reports and conferences addressing urban challenges, including the 1976 Vancouver Conference on Human Settlements.</p>
        <p>1980s: The Brundtland Commission's 1987 report, "Our Common Future," introduced the concept of sustainable development and highlighted the need for balanced growth that does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The idea of sustainable urban development began to gain traction.</p>

        <h2>Global Initiatives and the Millennium Development Goals</h2>
        <p>1990s: The United Nations began to focus more directly on urban issues, culminating in the Habitat II conference in 1996, which resulted in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda. These documents outlined strategies for improving the living conditions in urban areas and laid the groundwork for future sustainable urban development initiatives.</p>
        <p>2000s: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), established in 2000, included targets related to improving living conditions in slums, though they did not specifically focus on urban sustainability as comprehensively as SDG 11 would later.</p>

        <h2>Formation of the Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
        <p>2012: The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. Discussions during this conference emphasized the need for a new, comprehensive framework to address urbanization, leading to the formulation of SDGs.</p>
        <p>2015: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by all United Nations Member States during the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. SDG 11 was officially included as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This goal was designed to address the specific challenges of urbanization, such as ensuring safe and affordable housing, sustainable transport, and resilience to disasters.</p>

        <h2>Current Focus and Implementation</h2>
        <p>2016-Present: Since the adoption of SDG 11, efforts have been directed at integrating this goal into national policies, urban planning strategies, and international cooperation. The goal has been incorporated into various local and global initiatives aimed at improving urban resilience, enhancing infrastructure, and promoting sustainable urban environments.</p>
