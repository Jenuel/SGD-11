                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">The rapid urbanization of the post-World War II era led to significant 
                        concerns about the growth of slums, inadequate infrastructure, and 
                        environmental degradation in cities. The concept of sustainable 
                        development began to take shape, with early reports and conferences 
                        addressing urban challenges, including the 1976 Vancouver Conference 
                        on Human Settlements.

                        introduced the concept of sustainable development and highlighted 
                        the need for balanced growth that does not compromise the ability 
                        of future generations to meet their needs. The idea of sustainable 
                        urban development began to gain traction.

                        in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda. 
                        These documents outlined strategies for improving the living conditions 
                        in urban areas and laid the groundwork for future sustainable urban development

                        Development Summit in September 2015. SDG 11 was officially 
                        included as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 
                        This goal was designed to address the specific challenges of 
                        urbanization, such as ensuring safe and affordable housing, 
                        sustainable transport, and resilience to disasters.

                         progress is anticipated in reducing urban inequality, improving public 
                         transportation, and increasing green spaces. Beyond 2030, efforts will

                         focus on adapting to emerging challenges such as climate change and
