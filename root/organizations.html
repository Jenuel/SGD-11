It is taking bold climate action and leading the way towards having a more sustainable future. <br> C40 also offers cities an effective forum to collaborate, share knowledge and drive meaningful action on climate change.
<br>A group of significant cities worldwide that have made a commitment to combating climate change is known as the C40 network. <br>The primary objective is to lower greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously promoting their economies and growth in ways <br>that respect the environment and the welfare of people.

Through the partnership, experts and mayors may collaborate to take climate action, <br> incorporating the community, the commercial sector, and other governmental levels. To lessen the consequences of climate change, effective teamwork, <BR>knowledge sharing, and the encouragement of meaningful, quantifiable activities are required.</p>

We advocate for low-emission, environmentally friendly, just, resilient, and circular development locally and have an impact on sustainability policies throughout more than 125 countries where we operate. <br> Currently serving ICLEI Members in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
                     and Thailand is the ICLEI Southeast Asia Secretariat (ICLEI SEAS), <br> which is headquartered in Manila, Philippines. When ICLEI SEAS was founded in 1999, it started out in the area <br>with the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) campaign in the Philippines. In 2002, it moved <br> on to Thailand and Indonesia. Since then, ICLEI's membership 
                    in these three nations has expanded quickly, prompting the <br>creation of the Indonesia Office in 2013 and the inclusion of Malaysia in 2014. </p>

access to resources, partners, and service providers from the public, commercial, and non-profit sectors <br>who can assist them in creating and putting into practice their resilience strategies; and
