              <p class="content">
                The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Metro Manila Development Authority 
                (MMDA) collaborated on the Metro Manila Flood Management Project, which was approved in 
                September 2017 and began to be implemented in the first quarter of 2018. The project was 
                supported by the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Metro Manila Flood 
                Management Project aims to enhance flood control in specific regions of Metro Manila. The 
                project will reduce the amount of solid waste discharged in rivers, create 20 new pumping 
                stations, update the 36 that are currently in use, and provide housing for impacted individuals 
                and communities. By constructing dependable infrastructure to lessen losses from floods, the 
                project would contribute to making Metro Manila more resilient.

                This DENR-EMB program addresses the safe and appropriate management of industrial chemicals 
                and hazardous wastes in all phases of their life cycle, including importation, manufacture, 
                distribution, transportation, use, and disposal, in accordance with RA 6969 Toxic Substances 
                and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Control Act of 1990. By significantly reducing their release 
                into the air, water, and soil, this program will help achieve target 12.4: the environmentally 
                sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in compliance with 
                established international frameworks, to minimize their detrimental effects on human health 
                and the environment.

              <p class="content">
                The National Housing Authority (NHA) is responsible for housing production through the 
                Resettlement Program (RP), which involves the acquisition and development of large tracts 
                of raw land to create serviced lots and housing units for families displaced from government 
                infrastructure projects and danger areas. The NHA targets Informal Settler Families (ISFs) 
                through different modalities, such as completed housing resettlement projects, home material 
                loan projects, and joint venture schemes with Local Government Units (LGUs). The RP can 
                involve completed housing or incremental housing strategies. A recent initiative is the 50 
                billion Oplan Likas housing program, which aims to relocate around 104,000 ISFs residing in 
                danger areas in Metro Manila.
