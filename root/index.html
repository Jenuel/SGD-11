            <p class="sdg-content">
                The Sustainable Development GoalsSDGs are a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations 
                in 2015. They aim to address a wide range of issues, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental 
                degradation, peace, and justice, by 2030. The SDGs provide a universal framework for governments, businesses, and 
                communities to work together towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
            </p>
            <p class="sdg-content">
                Each of the 17 SDGs is interconnected, emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to achieve sustainable development. 
                The goals are designed to be inclusive, leaving no one behind, and they encourage collaboration across sectors, countries, 
                and organizations. By aligning efforts with the SDGs, entities can contribute to global progress while also addressing local 
                challenges, ultimately fostering a healthier planet and more prosperous societies. As the world faces increasing environmental 
                and social pressures, the SDGs serve as a critical roadmap for guiding policy, business strategies, and community initiatives 
                toward a resilient and sustainable future.
