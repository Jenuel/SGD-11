            <p class="about-us-heading">ABOUT US</p>
            <p class="about-us-content first">
                We are undergraduate college students of Computer Science who are dedicated to supporting sustainable development through the United Nations’ 
                Sustainable Development Goals <abbr title="SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS">(SDGs)</abbr>. These 17  goals, established in 2015, aim to address 
                important global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and access to justice by 2030. The <abbr title="SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS">SDGs</abbr> 
                provide a clear framework for governments, businesses, and communities to work together toward a more sustainable and fair future.
            <p class="about-us-content second">
                Our approach emphasizes the interconnected nature of these goals <abbr title="SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS">(SDGs)</abbr>, encouraging collaboration 
                across different sectors to solve local and global challenges. We believe that by aligning our efforts with the <abbr title="SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS">SDGs</abbr>, we can support positive change 
                and contribute to a more sustainable, balanced world. Our work on promoting practical and achievable solutions that contribute to better urban 
                planning, environmental care, and social fairness. We aim to raise awareness, encourage cooperation, and support efforts that  help create a more 
                sustainable future for everyone.

            <p class="mission-heading">OUR MISSION</p>
            <p class="mission-content first">
                Our mission is to raise awareness about building cities that are inclusive, safe, and sustainable. As more people move to cities 70% of 
                the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050 we believe that informed people and communities can help solve the
                challenges of rapid growth. Today, over a billion people live in poor housing, and many cities struggle to provide the infrastructure 
                and services needed.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-content second">
                As college students, our mission is about learning and sharing information. By spreading awareness and  discussing how cities are planned 
                and managed, students can make a difference in their own communities. Small actions, like talking about the need for better housing, public 
                transport, and green spaces, can lead to real change. We want to help students understand the importance of planning for safer, healthier, 
                and more resilient cities. Through sharing ideas and raising awareness, students can be part of building a future where cities are better 
                for everyone.
